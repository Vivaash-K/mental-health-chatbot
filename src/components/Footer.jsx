      question: "How does the YouMatter AI chatbot support mental health?",
      answer: "YouMatter uses AI to offer supportive, non-judgmental conversations tailored to how you're feeling. Whether you just want a friendly chat, need someone to listen, or want guidance, our chatbot is designed to understand and respond in real time—day or night. While it's not a therapist, it's here to help you reflect, feel heard, and find calming strategies when you need them most."
    },
    {
      question: "Can the chatbot replace a licensed therapist?",
      answer: "No. YouMatter is not a substitute for therapy or clinical care. While it's designed using emotional support principles like CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and active listening, it doesn't offer medical advice or diagnoses. Think of it as a companion to help between therapy sessions, or when human support isn't immediately available."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the chatbot diagnose mental health conditions?",
      answer: "No, YouMatter does not diagnose any mental health disorders. It simply offers conversation, reflection prompts, and emotional wellness tips based on your inputs. For any clinical concerns or emergencies, we strongly recommend reaching out to mental health professionals or crisis helplines."
    },
    {
      question: "What mental health challenges can YouMatter help with?",
      answer: "Our AI chatbot supports emotional wellness in areas like anxiety, overthinking, loneliness, motivation, stress, self-talk, and burnout. It can also guide you through breathing exercises, mood tracking, and simple calming techniques."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my personal data safe and private?",
      answer: "Yes. YouMatter prioritizes your privacy and emotional safety. We do not store any personally identifiable information unless you choose to create an account or journal entries. All data exchanged is handled securely, and anonymous usage is always available."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use YouMatter when I just want someone to talk to?",
      answer: "Absolutely. YouMatter isn't just for when you're feeling low. Sometimes we just need a kind voice or a thoughtful chat. That's why we've included three modes—Friend, Listener, and Advice—so you can talk to the chatbot in a way that fits your mood."
